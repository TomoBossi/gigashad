# shaders
*We have Shadertoy at home.*

## Why?
Because I wanted to run fragment shaders locally without using a web browser. This is because:
- I wanted complete control over I/O and keyboard/mouse controls.
- It's more performant this way dude, just trust me.
- I don't like web browsers.

## What?
This is a minimal OpenGL fragment shader renderer. This is also where I'd put my own shaders, if I had any.

## How?
Compile and run the program. You'll figure it out.
